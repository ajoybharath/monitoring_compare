Terraform:

You can use the terraform (*.tf) files in the terraform branch of this repository and use that to create AWS EC2 instances for Installing and Configuring Nagios and Prometheus.

Install terraform and ansible in your laptop as described in info.txt

terraform init 
terraform plan
terraform apply

NOTE: The prom_tf directory has a ansible playbook to install docker and git in the instance we create for prometheus.
We are using containers to run prometheus.

Nagios:

You can use nagios-src directory to install and configure Nagios from scratch.
This folder has an ansible playbook for this. If the ansible is failing for any reason you can follow the steps mentioned to install it manually.

Also it has a nagios_docker directory which describes to start Nagios in few easy steps.

Prometheus:

You can do a git clone to get this repository to your prometheus instance you created using terraform and run the command

docker-compose up -d 

You'll be having multiple containers running in your instance.

execute the coomd below to see more details.
